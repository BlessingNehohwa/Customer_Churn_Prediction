# Customer_Churn_Rate_Prediction

<b> Business problem:</b> 

Using the Bank_customer  dataset to predict customer churn. The data set has following features:- 
- RowNumber  
- CustomerId 
- Surname
- CreditScore
- Geography
- Gender
- Age
- Tenure
- Balance
- NumOfProducts
- HasCrCard
- IsActiveMember
- EstimatedSalary
- Exited'

We need to determine whether a customer will exit or not? Hence this is a classification problem therefore will use classification
algorithms namely :-
1. Logistic regression
2. RandomForest Classifier
3. XGBoost 
                                  
  <b> Conclusion :</b>
 - After training and testing all the three algorithms, random Forest classifier algorith had the highest accuracy of 86% changed parameters and it increased to 87%.
 i built my model and it made its first prediction.
